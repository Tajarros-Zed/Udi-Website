            <p>Bonuan Blue Beach or commonly known as Tondaligan Beach is located at Bonuan Tondaligan, Dagupan City. It is one of the 
                most popular beaches here in Pangasinan. Most of us already heard some negative comments about this beach. But hey! The 
                beach has been rehabilitated and now it is different from the Bonuan Blue Beach that is on our mind. This place is a good 
                place for picnics and relaxation. It is clean and well-organized. There is a children's park that kids will surely love. 
                It's just a minutes away from the city proper.</p>
