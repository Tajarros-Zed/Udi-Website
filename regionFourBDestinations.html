            <p><b>Secret Lagoon Beach</b> - It’s no secret that El Nido has been blessed with more than its fair share of postcard perfect scenic locations. From
                majestic limestone formation jutting out from crystal clear turquoise seas to powdery white sandy beaches along its coastlines, not to mention
                the sheer diversity of marine wildlife in its perfectly hued oceans, it’s no wonder foreign publications have declared it the best beach and island
                destination in the Philippines. As soon as your boat docks near the lagoon, your guide will direct you to a small opening hidden between a
                towering wall of limestone rocks by the seashore. It’s easy to miss this secret spot, and most people wonder if it’s possible to crawl through this
                tiny hole.</p><p>
                But once you get through it, you’ll be greeted by an unusual sight: a massive limestone rock formation surrounding a small body of water right
                in the middle of it.
                Enclosed within a lagoon and eclipsed by towering rocks all around you, this awe-inspiring scenery lends an otherworldly experience for
                visitors.</p><p>
                Depending on where your boat is parked, you’ll find more secret coves and hidden white sand beaches in the areas surrounding the secret
                lagoon. Take your time look around beyond the tiny opening to the secret lagoon, and you’ll be rewarded with more spectacular nooks and
                crannies waiting to be discovered.</p>
                <b>How to get there</b><p>
                Located among the many islets dotting the majestic Bacuit Bay in El Nido, the lagoon is situated on the southern part of Miniloc island. It takes
                some effort to get there - aside from having to ride an outrigger boat to reach it, be prepared to get wet and to step on some sharp rocks, so
                put on some aqua shoes for good measure.

            <p><b>Seven Commando Beach</b> - The 7 Commandos Beach is part of El Nido Island Hopping Tour A. Its long sloping stretch of fine sand and coconut
                trees welcome the guests after a long day of island hopping. It is yet to be confirmed how the beach got its name, but one consistent story is
                that of the seven soldiers who got stranded here during WWII. Whether that story is true or not, the important thing is happily spending your
                much-deserved holiday here before marching back to work.</p>
                <b>How to Get There</b><p>
                Nearest Airport: El Nido Airport, also known as Lio Airport (Palawan); Puerto Princesa International Airport (Palawan); Francisco B. Reyes

                There are three possible gateways to El Nido from Manila: El Nido Airport is the nearest and the most convenient one, but airfare can be too
                steep. Busuanga Airport is an option to consider for those who are planning to do Coron-El Nido tour. For those who want to enjoy both Puerto
                Princesa and El Nido to the fullest, Puerto Princesa Airport is the most popular choice.</p><p>
                1.Coming from Manila, it will take you around 1 hour to get to Puerto Princesa International Airport. Check your preferred airline company for
                the flight schedule and airfare.</p><p>

                Via van, there are shuttle vans at the airport or you may take a tricycle or multi-cab going to Robinson’s Mall where the van terminal is located.

            <p> <b>Las Cabanas Beach</b> - Las Cabanas Beach El Nido is undoubtedly the best place to catch a sunset. With bars and restaurants along the strip,
                you can’t ask for anything more.
                <p><b>How To Get To Las Cabanas Beach From El Nido</b></p>
                Las Cabanas Beach is located around 5km from El Nido main town.
                The best option is to grab a tricycle from El Nido town centre which will take around 15 minutes.
                We paid 150 pesos between three people for a one-way trip ($1 USD per person).
                There is now a pick up and drop off point specifically for trikes. They will drop you outside of Vanilla Beach shopping centre and you can walk
                through to the beach. Then simply head back to the same point when you’re ready to grab a lift back to town.
                If you want to make your own way there by scooter, you can rent one from El Nido town from around 500 pesos per day.

                <p><b>Best Time to Visit Las Cabanas Beach + Tips</b></p>
                For the best beach weather, it’s best to visit El Nido during the dry season, between November and April.
                If spending the day at the beach get there early to have the choice of the best spots.
                Don’t miss sunset here. If you can make it you won’t be disappointed!
                When you arrive at the beach for sunset, head as far left as possible so you’ll be facing towards the sun going down.

        <div class="aboutLuzonBeach">
            <p> <b>Nacpan Beach</b> - Nacpan Beach is a four-kilometer strip of cream-colored sand and coconut trees with crystal clear turquoise water. It is
                located 17th kilometers north of El Nido town proper in Palawan. This powdery paradise was one of the secret getaways for some tourists until
                its beauty was discovered by many and became one of the most sought-after destinations in El Nido. In 2016, it was voted as the world’s 10th
                best beach by users of travel rating website Trip Advisor.</p>
                <b>What to do</b><p>
                Despite its popularity, the Nacpan Beach generally has few visitors. Hence, it is ideal for those who prefer to quietly reflect and relax while
                being one with nature. Tourists can simply lie on the beach or settle in hammocks if they want to do some sunbathing. They can also opt to rest
                in Nacpan’s shady spots.
                Aside from swimming, visitors can also do surfing, kayaking, and stand-up paddleboard. Mask, fins, and snorkel can be rented for those who
                want to explore the crystal-clear water.
                There are restaurants along the coast that range from affordable to expensive. There are also snacks for sale along the beach’s entrance
                although the selection is limited.
                Nearby tourist destinations
                Nacpan is one-half of the popular twin beaches in the area—the other one is called Calitang Beach. The two beaches merge in a narrow sandbar
                that snakes into a lush hill, which offers an excellent view of Nacpan and Calitang. Tourists must trek to the southern portion of Nacpan to
                reach the hill where it meets with the smaller Calitang Beach. Calitang is also a stretch of white sand but its waves are calmer than those in
                Nacpan. It is a fishing village with multi-colored boats anchored along the shore.
                </p><b>How to Get There</b><p>
                El Nido is the jumpoff point to visit Nacpan Beach. To reach the town of El Nido, travel by bus or van from Puerto Princesa. Once you arrive,
                there are several options you can take to get to Nacpan Beach, which is about 17km away from El Nido town proper.
                The most convenient and comfortable way is to book a shuttle service, which is usually part of organized tours going to Nacpan Beach. You will
                be picked up from your hotel and also get dropped off here coming back. This is also a great way to meet other travelers as you will most likely
                be sharing the service with other individuals or groups.
                For a more authentic island experience, you can choose to hop on a tricycle to get to Nacpan Beach. While this will cost cheaper, expect a more
                bumpy ride as some parts of the road going to the beach are not fully cemented and sometimes muddy.
                You can also choose to rent a motorbike and drive your way to Nacpan. Most budget travelers and thrill-seekers opt to do this since rental rates
                for an entire day cost way cheaper than shuttle or tricycle service, plus they also have the freedom to go at their own pace and explore other
                places around Nacpan Beach and the rest of El Nido. As mentioned, some roads leading to Nacpan are still not in great conditions so be extra
                careful when choosing this transport option.
                </p><b>Best Time to Visit</b><p>
                One would simply agree that island getaways and beach escapades need fully sunny and bright days and calm waters. Given such, it is highly
                recommended to visit Nacpan Beach during the country’s dry months from November to May. But since this is peak travel season, especially
                during the summer months of March until May, expect to bump into a crowd of tourists — although it does not get too busy compared to other
                popular beach destinations in the Philippines.
                Exploring the enchanting Nacpan Beach and the rest of El Nido’s magnificent islands during dry months also prove to be a safer choice, because
                heavy rains, strong winds, and rough seas are most likely to be experienced during the wet season from June to October. The advantages
                though of traveling during this time are cheaper flights, lower hotel rates, and lesser crowds.
                Nacpan Beach is open any time of the day, but it is best to get there early and soak up all of its beauty for the entire day and take advantage of
                the sun, especially if you plan on getting that golden tan. Stay until late afternoon to witness the glorious sunset here.</p>
